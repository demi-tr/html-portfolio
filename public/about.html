<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm an oral health therapist ('OHT') by trade, nobody ever knows what that is so let me enlighten you briefly! <br />OHTs basically:
  <li>Treat children for all general dentistry, except for root canals. This includes fillings, examinations, cleans, taking radiographs, extractions, basic nerve treatment (pulpotomy).</li>
  <li>Primary dentition extractions only</li>
  <li>Some of us will also do dental hygiene (I absolutely do not enjoy this aspect so do not).</li>
  <br /></p>
</p>

<p>I've worked clinically, as a lecturer in academia and clinical tutor/supervisor training future OHTs. <br><br>I'm currently transitioning careers
  into legal (part-way through my JD) and I'm also getting back into web development, in addition to that (as I used to code when I was 11!</p>

<p>I'm keeping my options open at this stage, but steering towards hybrid/legal-tech based career.</p>
